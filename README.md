# TinyCS

TinyCS is a lightweight compressed sensing toolkit designed to
allow casual MR imaging scientists to design undersampled
acquisitions and reconstruct the resulting data.

Currently, TinyCS supports Cartesian geometries with a total
variation constrained reconstruction only.  If there is
sufficient interest, I can add additional acquisition designs
and sparsity constraints.
